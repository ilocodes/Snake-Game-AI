<h1>Snake Game Built With AI</h1>

This is a basic snake game made with HTML, CSS and Javascript using ChatGPT 3.5. The whole coding solution was provided by ChatGPT without writing a single code from one's side. It was nice experince to try coding a simple game with no prior knowledge to HTML, CSS and Javascript. Hopefully after having grasped front-end languages, i can use AI in near future for my own personel projects.
