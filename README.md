<h1>Snake Game Built With AI</h1>

This is a basic snake game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using ChatGPT-3.5. The entire code solution was provided by ChatGPT without any manual coding on the user's part. It was a nice experience to try coding a simple game with no prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hopefully, after having grasped front-end languages, I can use AI in the near future for my own personal projects.

To deploy to Github Pages, i had followed a tutorial on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpTjJk-pt6s&list=WL&index=1). This tutorial guides the viewer step by step on how to deploy a website with JavaScript onto GitHub Pages.

You can access the game from [Github Pages](https://ilocodes.github.io/Snake-Game-AI/).
