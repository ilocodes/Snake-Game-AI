### Snake Game Built With ChatGPT

Simple Snake Game powered by AI! This game is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the code generated by ChatGPT-3.5. It's a great experience to try AI in game development. To deploy the game to GitHub Pages i followed a tutorial on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpTjJk-pt6s&list=WL&index=1) This tutorial guides the viewer step by step on how to deploy a website using Three.js onto GitHub Pages. 

You can access the game from [Github Pages](https://ilocodes.github.io/Snake-Game-AI/).

*Note: This is an experimental attempt to see if a game could be built by AI. The source code lacks simple features. Once I develop my front-end skills, I would like to improve the game.*
